"""
GatewayAdmin — mountable Starlette sub-application for the gateway admin UI.

Extends starlette-cms at init time by registering the gateway API routes on the CMS
via :meth:`~starlette_cms.app.CMS.register_extension_route`, then serves a
shell page from its own sub-application.

Sync state (job records, the cursor, the retry list) is stored in the CMS's own
SQLite file by default: the one file that is persistent and backed up. The tables
sit beside the CMS's and never appear in the block registry or editor UI.

Usage::

    from starlette_cms import CMS
    from starlette_cms_gateways.admin import GatewayAdmin
    from starlette.applications import Starlette
    from starlette.routing import Mount

    cms = CMS(database_url="sqlite:///content.db", auth="apikey", api_key="secret")
    admin = GatewayAdmin(cms=cms)

    app = Starlette(
        routes=[
            Mount("/cms", app=cms.app),
            Mount("/gateways", app=admin.app),
        ],
        lifespan=cms.lifespan,
    )

Shell:   GET  /gateways/shell
API:     GET  /cms/api/gateways
         GET  /cms/api/gateways/{name}
         POST /cms/api/gateways/{name}/sync
         GET  /cms/api/gateways/{name}/sync/{run_id}
         GET/PUT /cms/api/gateways/{name}/cursor     (sync state for outside workers)
         GET/PUT /cms/api/gateways/{name}/retry
         POST    /cms/api/gateways/{name}/runs
         PATCH   /cms/api/gateways/{name}/runs/{run_id}

    Mountable Starlette gateway admin sub-application.

    :param cms: The CMS instance to extend.  The gateway API routes are
        registered on it via
        :meth:`~starlette_cms.app.CMS.register_extension_route` at init time.
        Must be called before the first access of ``cms.app``.
    :param mount_path: The path this admin UI is mounted at.  Defaults to
        ``"/gateways"``.
    :param auth: Optional auth callable ``(request) -> bool`` protecting the
        ``/shell`` HTML page.  API routes always use the CMS auth model
        (``Authorization: Bearer <api_key>``).  Defaults to ``None`` — set
        this when the admin is exposed on a public server.
    :param jobs_db_path: SQLite file for sync state (job records, the cursor, the
        retry list).  Defaults to **the CMS's own database file**, so the state is
        as persistent and as backed up as the content (a Litestream replica of the
        CMS database carries it too).  When the CMS is not on a SQLite file
        (Postgres, in-memory) the default falls back to ``gateway_jobs.db`` in the
        working directory, with a warning: pass a path that outlives restarts.
        Ignored if *job_store* is provided.
    :param job_store: A pre-built :class:`~starlette_cms_gateways.jobstore.JobStore`
        instance.  Use this to share a job store across multiple components or
        to control the database path explicitly.  When provided, *jobs_db_path*
        is ignored (a warning is emitted if one was also passed).
